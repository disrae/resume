Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a highly motivated full-stack developer with extensive experience in cloud-native applications and TypeScript/JavaScript development. At Goose Insurance, I architected and developed scalable server-driven solutions using React Native and Node.js. My expertise directly aligns with KPMG's tech stack requirements - I have deep experience with React.js, Node.js API development, and modern cloud architectures, complemented by strong TypeScript skills and proficiency with Tailwind CSS.

What excites me about the Cloud Centre of Excellence role is the opportunity to help shape cloud service platforms while maintaining operational excellence. My experience collaborating with cross-functional teams and documenting technical solutions would enable me to effectively guide business teams in platform adoption. I have a proven track record of innovating within constraints - at Goose Insurance, I designed and implemented a recursive layout system for backend-driven UI rendering that significantly improved maintainability. With my background in cloud-native development, combined with a passion for operational excellence and security best practices, I am confident I would be a valuable addition to KPMG's cloud services team.
