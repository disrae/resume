# 🎯 ATS Optimization Guide

This guide helps you create resumes that pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) while remaining professional and readable.

## 📊 Understanding ATS Systems

ATS software scans resumes for:
- **Keywords** from job descriptions
- **Proper formatting** and structure
- **Relevant experience** and skills
- **Education and certifications**
- **Contact information**

## ✅ ATS-Friendly Best Practices

### 1. **Keyword Optimization**
- Match 70-80% of job description keywords
- Use industry-specific terms
- Include both technical and soft skills
- Place keywords naturally in context

**AI Prompt:**
```
Analyze this job description and extract the top 15 keywords I should include in my resume.
Prioritize technical skills, tools, and industry terms.
```

### 2. **Structure & Formatting**
- Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Inter)
- Avoid tables, columns, graphics, and text boxes
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Keep consistent formatting throughout

### 3. **File Format**
- PDF format is ATS-friendly
- Save as "First Last - Resume.pdf"
- Avoid fancy file names with special characters

### 4. **Content Organization**

#### Professional Summary
- 3-5 sentences highlighting key qualifications
- Include 2-3 target job titles
- Quantify achievements where possible

#### Experience Section
- Use reverse chronological order
- Include company name, job title, dates
- Start each bullet with strong action verbs
- Quantify achievements (%, $, time saved)

#### Skills Section
- List technical skills prominently
- Group by category (Technical, Tools, Soft Skills)
- Use job-specific terminology

## 🚫 Common ATS Mistakes to Avoid
